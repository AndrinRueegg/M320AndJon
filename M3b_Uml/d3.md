### Application Delegation

Our application is a Sokoban-inspired puzzle game designed to demonstrate the concept of **delegation** by separating user input handling from core game logic. For example, the `GameIO` class focuses solely on managing graphical rendering and input events, while delegating tasks like player movement and state updates to the `Game` class. This clear distinction ensures modularity and maintainability.

The application also incorporates robust **exception handling** to manage user input errors and unexpected game states. Custom exceptions, such as `PortalException` and `InvalidLevelException`, are used to handle scenarios like invalid portal interactions or incorrect level selections. These exception classes provide detailed error messages to guide users and ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

With a mix of features like portals, hazards, checkpoints, and multiple levels of increasing difficulty, the game achieves sufficient complexity for a Level 3 application while maintaining clarity through modular design principles.


Our application demonstrates delegation in:

Input Handling: Delegating movement logic to the Game class. <br>
Portal Handling: Delegating complex portal logic to the getPortalExit method.  <br>
Dialog Handling: Delegating all user interaction tasks to the CustomDialog class.  <br>


# Example: 
### Portal Logic Delegation
In the `Game` class, the logic for handling portals is delegated to the `getPortalExit` method. This method encapsulates all portal-related calculations, ensuring the `move` method remains focused on managing player movement.

**Code Example:**
```java
if (tileVal == 7 || tileVal == 8) { // Check if the player is on a portal
    try {
        Point exitPos = getPortalExit(newX, newY, dx, dy); // Delegates portal logic
        if (exitPos != null) {
            newX = exitPos.x;
            newY = exitPos.y;
        }
    } catch (PortalException e) {
        resetAfterDeath(); // Handle portal errors gracefully
        return;
    }
}
```

**`getPortalExit` Method:**
```java
private Point getPortalExit(int pX, int pY, int dx, int dy) {
    List<Point> fromList = (tile == 7) ? portalsPurple : portalsGreen;
    List<Point> toList = (tile == 7) ? portalsGreen : portalsPurple;

    int idx = fromList.indexOf(new Point(pX, pY));
    if (idx < 0 || idx >= toList.size()) {
        return null; // No valid exit
    }

    Point otherPortal = toList.get(idx);
    int idealX = otherPortal.x + dx;
    int idealY = otherPortal.y + dy;

    if (!isFreeTile(idealX, idealY)) {
        throw new PortalException("Player stuck after portal! Invalid block: " + gameField[idealY][idealX]);
    }

    return new Point(idealX, idealY);
}
```

The portal logic is fully encapsulated within `getPortalExit`, leaving the `move` method clean and focused.
