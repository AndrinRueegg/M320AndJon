### Application Description

Our application is a Sokoban-inspired puzzle game designed to demonstrate the concept of **delegation** by separating user input handling from core game logic. For example, the `GameIO` class focuses solely on managing graphical rendering and input events, while delegating tasks like player movement and state updates to the `Game` class. This clear distinction ensures modularity and maintainability.

The application also incorporates robust **exception handling** to manage user input errors and unexpected game states. Custom exceptions, such as `PortalException` and `InvalidLevelException`, are used to handle scenarios like invalid portal interactions or incorrect level selections. These exception classes provide detailed error messages to guide users and ensure a smooth gameplay experience.

With a mix of features like portals, hazards, checkpoints, and multiple levels of increasing difficulty, the game achieves sufficient complexity for a Level 3 application while maintaining clarity through modular design principles.
