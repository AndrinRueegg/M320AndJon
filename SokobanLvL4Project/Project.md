## Overview
This project is a Sokoban-inspired puzzle game developed in Java, featuring enhanced gameplay mechanics and a visually appealing interface. Players solve puzzles by moving boxes onto checkpoints, collecting coins, and avoiding hazards like lava. Portals add a unique twist, teleporting players and boxes to new locations for added complexity.
